Here is a list of 100 advanced questions on data structures:

1. What is a trie data structure?
Answer: A trie is a tree-like data structure used to store associative arrays where the keys are usually strings.

2. What is a B-tree data structure?
Answer: A B-tree is a self-balancing tree data structure that keeps data sorted and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time.

3. What is a hash table data structure?
Answer: A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values using a hash function that computes an index into an array of buckets or slots.

4. What is a segment tree data structure?
Answer: A segment tree is a tree data structure used for range queries and updates on an array or a list.

5. What is a skip list data structure?
Answer: A skip list is a probabilistic data structure used for fast searching, insertion, and deletion operations.

6. What is a Fibonacci heap data structure?
Answer: A Fibonacci heap is a heap data structure used for priority queue operations that provides amortized constant-time operations.

7. What is a red-black tree data structure?
Answer: A red-black tree is a self-balancing binary search tree data structure that ensures logarithmic time complexity for basic operations.

8. What is a AVL tree data structure?
Answer: An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree data structure that ensures logarithmic time complexity for basic operations.

9. What is a splay tree data structure?
Answer: A splay tree is a self-adjusting binary search tree data structure that adjusts itself after every operation to optimize future access.

10. What is a Fenwick tree data structure?
Answer: A Fenwick tree, also known as a binary indexed tree, is a data structure used to perform efficient range queries and updates on an array or a list.

11. What is a rope data structure?
Answer: A rope is a binary tree data structure used for efficiently storing and manipulating large string data.

12. What is a suffix array data structure?
Answer: A suffix array is a data structure that stores all the suffixes of a string in lexicographical order.

13. What is a bloom filter data structure?
Answer: A bloom filter is a probabilistic data structure used to test whether an element is a member of a set.

14. What is a k-d tree data structure?
Answer: A k-d tree is a binary search tree data structure used for efficient range searches and nearest neighbor searches in a k-dimensional space.

15. What is a van Emde Boas tree data structure?
Answer: A van Emde Boas tree is a tree data structure used for fast operations on sets of integers.

16. What is a quadtree data structure?
Answer: A quadtree is a tree data structure used to partition two-dimensional space by recursively subdividing it into four quadrants or regions.

17. What is a octree data structure?
Answer: An octree is a tree data structure used to partition three-dimensional space by recursively subdividing it into eight octants or regions.

18. What is a rope data structure?
Answer: A rope is a data structure used for efficiently storing and manipulating large strings.

19. What is a suffix tree data structure?
Answer: A suffix tree is a data structure used to store all the suffixes of a string in a compact form.

20. What is a Cartesian tree data structure?
Answer: A Cartesian tree is a binary tree data structure used for efficiently solving range minimum query problems.
