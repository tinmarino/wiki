# Tipos de plasticos

1. Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) – PET bottles, plastic jars, containers

2. High density polyethylene (HDP) – Milk bottles, liquid soap and shampoo bottles, detergent cans

3. Low-density polyethylene (LDP) – Plastic chairs, flooring, tiles, curtains, carrier bags, bin liners

4. Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) – PVC pipes, door and window frames, automotive parts

5. Polypropylene (PP) – Plastic corks, plastic bottle caps, battery casing

6.Polystyrene (PS) – Food packaging, food containers, disposable plastic ware, electronic goods and toys, insulating material used in construction industry

7. Polyamides (PA) – Tubing, toothbrush bristles

## 1 PET - Polyethylene Terephthalate : Recyclable but NOT Resuable

* [Plastic Pet](Plastic-Pet)
* Tereftalato de Polietileno  en espanol
* Envases de bebidas gaseosas, jugos, jarabes, aceites comestibles, bandejas, articulos de farmacia, medicamentos.
* Repeated use increases the risk of leaching and bacterial growth.
* The plastic is crushed and then shredded into small flakes which are then reprocessed to make new PET bottles, or spun into polyester fiber
* Production worldwide 41MT in 2014 and 73 MT in 2020 (forcasted) 1MT in INdia
* $1,160-1,215/tonne  CFR (cost & freight), 2015 in Chile
* Price India Rs 14-15/kg (dirty) :  Rs 50-110/kg (clean)
### PET price
* Ramener une bouteille en plastique vous permet de bénéficier d'un bon d'achat de 0,02euros dans le magasin lié à votre collecteur.
* The closed-loop recycling of used PET bottles into new food-grade PET containers is one of the most desirable means of dramatically extending the environmental benefits and sustainability of PET as a packaging material. 
* Temuco 200 tonnes/mois recyclée, materiel polystar apparement


## 2 HDPE - High-Density Polyethylene : Recyclable and Reusable

* HDPE plastic is the stiff plastic used to make milk jugs, detergent and oil bottles, toys, and some plastic bags


## 3 PVC - Polyvinyl Chloride Not recyclable

* PVC is dubbed the “poison plastic” because it contains numerous toxins which it can leach throughout its entire life cycle

## 4 LDPE - Low-Density Polyethylene

* LDPE is often found in shrink wraps, dry cleaner garment bags, squeezable bottles, and the type of plastic bags used to package bread
* LDPE is considered less toxic than other plastics, and relatively safe for use


## 5 PP - Polypropylene

* Polypropylene plastic is tough and lightweight, and has excellent heat-resistance qualities. It serves as a barrier against moisture, grease and chemicals
* PP is also commonly used for disposable diapers, pails, plastic bottle tops, margarine and yogurt containers, potato chip bags, straws, packing tape and rope.
* Recycled PP is used to make landscaping border stripping, battery cases, brooms, bins and trays.


## 6 PS - Polystyrene (!! Very BAD)

* Because polystyrene is structurally weak and ultra-lightweight, it breaks up easily and is dispersed readily throughout the natural environment. Beaches all over the world have bits of polystyrene lapping at the shores, and an untold number of marine species have ingested this plastic with immeasurable consequences to their health.
* While the technology for recycling polystyrene is available, the market for recycling is small


## 7 Other - BPA, Polycarbonate and LEXAN

* The #7 category was designed as a catch-all for polycarbonate (PC) and “other” plastics, so reuse and recycling protocols are not standardized within this category.
* PLA : Compostable (bio plastics)
