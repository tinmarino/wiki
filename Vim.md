### Jump matching endif

runtime macros/matchit.vim

### Not clearing screen after leaving (for git diff)

`set t_te=`
By default VIM, when terminating, sends the string configured with the option t_te to the hosting terminal to tell it to clear the screen. To avoid it just :set t_te= to send nothing to the terminal and avoid screen clearing. See :help term form more information about terminal capabilities.

### Copy all match

```vim
qaq
:%s//\=setreg('A', submatch(0), 'V')/gn
```

### Version and patch

if v:version == 704 && has('patch399')
