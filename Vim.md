## FRom before

set autochdir to auto chdir to current file
:tabdo lcd /dir/
Another useful setting is set tags=./tags,tags;$HOME which tells Vim to look
    for a tags file in the directory of the current file, then in the "current
    directory" and up and up until it reaches your ~/. 
getpid()
vim â€”cmd 'cd `pwd`'

:pc :pclose
:pc[lose][!]    Close any "Preview" window currently open.  When the 'hidden'
                option is set, or when the buffer was changed and the [!] is
                used, the buffer becomes hidden (unless there is another
                window editing it).  The command fails if any "Preview" buffer
                cannot be closed.  See also :close.

The safest way without destroying a register is to do the following:

p`[

If you want to create a shortcut, just use any of vim's map functions that are suitable for you, eg:

noremap p p`[

Something likelet $vimfiles = "c:\\ldigas-home\\gvim72\\vim\\vimfiles"so when I go cd $vimfiles  it puts me inc:\ldigas-home\gvim72\\vim\vimfilesOr did you have so



set shell=/bin/bash\ -i

Vim's default CTRL-T is a good alternative to mashing CTRL-O, because it is coarser grained: it moves back through tag jumps only
