# Chapter 1

## Being a diver

* Air in ears, sinuses, lungs, mask, blockd air in intestine (fart) and, when using one, a dry suit. This also affect buyacy (how long air last).
* __Breathe continuously, never ever hold your breath__.
* Breathe solwly and deeply, like Buddha.
* Buoyancy is what cancels the pull of gravity, allowing you to “fly” and feel “weightless”.
* Positive buoyancy means you float.
* __Buoyancy Control Device__ (BCD) and __weight system__ is the way to control buoyancy. Additionally wet to dry suit, lungs
* __Body__ plna, help, check, remind, assist, encourage, add fun to the dive.
* The body system is practical, safe and fun

## Equipment

1. Dive Masks
2. Cylinders
3. Regulators
4. BCD Buoyancy Control Device
5. Weight Systems
6. Fins
7. Snorkels

* Choose equipment due to 1. Suitability, 2. Fit, 3. Comfort
* Secondady considerations: 4. Cost and features, 4. Serviceability (anual or bi-anual), 5. Color and style, 6. Accessories
* There are two basic fin styles: adjustable strap and full-foot
* webbed gloves = hand fins
* DPVs – Diver Propulsion Vehicles (a.k.a. “scooters”
* Primary considerations in choosing fins are fit and blade size
* Choose your scuba kit based on your size, preferences and the types of dive adventures that appeal to you
* Scuba Kit = the entier set BCD, Regulator, Cylinder, Weight system
* BCD:
    1. Inflatable bladder – This is a very durable bag that you inflate or deflate to change your buoyancy.
    2. Cylinder band and harness/jacket – The bladder integrates with an adjustable harness that holds the cylinder on your back. The bladder may be entirely behind you, or wrap partially around your waist and/or over your shoulders. With some systems, you can interchange harnesses and bladders to accommodate sizing and preferences.
    3. LPI (low pressure inflator) mechanism – Usually at the end of a large-diameter hose, the LPI inflates the bladder with air from your cylinder, via the regulator, when you press a button. Another button allows you to deflate the bladder, or inflate it orally.
    4. Overpressure/quick exhaust valves – To prevent rupturing the bladder due to overfilling, BCDs have one or more overpressure valves that automatically vent if the BCD is too full. Some may have “quick dump” valves that let you manually release air, which is sometimes easier (due to your position in the water) than using the LPI exhaust.
    5. Weight system – Many BCDs have special weight pockets that you can release and drop in an emergency. The more weight you need (like when wearing a buoyant dry suit), the more useful these are. (More about weight systems shortly).
* BCD Maintenance with: rinse the inside of the bladder with fresh water as well as the outside. Store most BCDs partially inflated. This helps keep the bladder from sticking together inside.
* Regulator:
    1. The first stage is the “hub” of your regulator and supplies air to the components.
    2. Second stage (i.e. inhalor)
    3. Alternate air source (aka Octopus)
    4. Low-pressure inflator hose
    5. The SPG/computer: Submersible Pressure Gauge (SPG)
* Cylinder material: steel and/or aluminum 
* Cylinder valve has a safety that release air much before explosion while charging. It is called the Burst disk, but do not overuse at its safety is to break itself (use once).
* Cylinder common sizes are 8, 10, 12 and 15 litres.

# Section 2

## Being a diver II

* Sound goes 4 times faster
* Red light is absorbed first
* Water absorbs heat 20 times faster than air
* The first air you inhale (“dead” air) with each breath is the air from your last exhalation, so it is higher in carbon dioxide.
* Dive Plan:
    1. Agree on the best entry and exit techniques for the environment.
    2. Decide what course you’ll follow.
    3. Agree on the maximum time and depth.
    4. Review underwater signals and other communications.
    5. Determine when you will turn the dive and head back based on your remaining air, time and/or other factors – whichever comes first.
    6. Agree on how you’ll stay together during the dive (e.g., swim side by side, one leads while the others follow, etc.).
    7. Establish what you will do if you become separated.
    8. Discuss emergency procedures.
    9. Agree on an objective. An objective may be detailed, such as “shoot videos of butterfly fish pairs,” or as simple as, “let’s go for a look.”
* BWRAF: Begin With Review And Friend:
    1. **Begin**: for **B**CD
    2. **With:** for **W**eight
    3. Review: Releases
    4. And: for Air
    5. Friend: **F**inal check
* How to descend
    1. Confirm that your buddies are ready.
    2. Orient yourselves to something at the surface or underwater, such as the boat or a landmark.
    3. Switch from your snorkel to your regulator.
    4. Check, and if necessary activate, your dive computer or timer. If in “sleep” mode, most dive computers self activate when you go underwater, but generally it’s best to have them active.
    5. Signal “descend” and, with your buddies, slowly deflate your BCD.
* Ascend
    1. Signal “up” and confirm that your buddies are ready.
    2. Check your dive computer to be sure you’re within its limits. (You’ll learn more about these limits later. If you’re not using a computer, check the time for use with dive tables.)
    3. Look up and hold up your BCD deflator hose. Do not add air to your BCD. If you’re properly weighted and neutrally buoyant, you only need to start swimming up gently.
    4. Ascend slowly – no faster than your dive computer’s maximum rate. The maximum ascent rate is 18 metres/60 feet per minute, but most dive computers require a slower rate of 10 metres/30 feet per minute. Most dive computers will warn you if you ascend too fast, so use your computer to guide your speed. Release air expanding in your BCD to control your buoyancy so you don’t start to rise too fast. If you’re not using a computer, use your timer and depth gauge to be sure you ascend no faster than 3 metres/10 feet each 10 seconds.
    5. Look up and turn as you ascend, and stay with your buddies. Watch for obstacles overhead. Reach up as you near and break through the surface.
* Safety stop is 5 minutes between 6 and 3m tipically 5m


## Equipment II

* Cutting Tools:
    1. Dive knife
    2. Dive tool
    3. Shears (Scissors)
    4. Z-knives (hooks with a blade)
* SPG (submersible pressure gauge) – As you’ve learned, this instrument tells you how much air remains in your cylinder
* Dive computer: Time + Depth + Time left
* Compass


## Skill II

# Section 3

## Being a Diver III

* The six general conditions are:
    1. temperature
    2. visibility
    3. water movement
    4. bottom composition
    5. aquatic life
    6. sunlight
* Themocline: The boundary between a warmer upper layer and a cooler deeper layer.
* I Am responsible for MY safety so I choose the go-no-go to dive
* The less you disturb the more you see (passive interaction)
* Animals can sting (infect like jellyfish) or bite (sharks)
* The PADI AWARE Foundation involves me and other divers as part of a movement to help keep our ocean clean and full of healthy, abundant marine life.
* Waves break in water slighly deeper than thei own height
* Waves cause Suerges and undertoe
* Surge is the back and forward motion
* Undertow is water from breaking waves going back to sea (the "suck back current" as I call it)
* Rip current is the convection due to a bar. Most accident from RIP current result from panic
* Boat terminology
* The bow – the front of the boat. “Forward” means toward the bow.
    * The stern – the back of the boat. “Aft” means toward the stern.
    * Port – The left side of the boat as you face forward.
    * Starboard – The right side of the boat as you face forward.
    * “Port” and “starboard” reduce confusion because they are always relative to the bow.
    * Leeward – The side away from the wind. It is often pronounced “loo-erd.”
    * Windward – The side toward the wind.
    * The bridge (wheelhouse) – The portion of the boat where the controls are; often elevated for visibility.
    * Head – The boat’s toilet facilities or the boat’s commode specifically.
    * Galley – The boat’s kitchen/cooking area (in some areas, most larger dive boats have galleys; in others, few do).
    * Swim step – A platform on the stern that is close to water level. You commonly enter and exit the water there.
* Dive Planning 4 steps
    1. Advanced planning (buy air ticket)
    2. Preparation planning (see with locals), Recheck Condition (see meteo)
    3. Last minute preparation
    4. Predive planning
* Dive Planning Checklist
    * Evaluate the conditions. Take the time you need to do this properly.
    * Decide whether the conditions are acceptable for diving. If not, go to an alternate site or cancel diving altogether. Diving is supposed to be fun and rewarding; if it won’t be, do something else.
    * Agree on techniques, including where/how to enter, the course to follow, techniques you’ll use during the dive and where/how to exit.
    * Review signals and communications as necessary.
        - You may need little or no review with buddies you dive with often.
        - Spend time on it with new buddies, or if you’ll need special signals.

    Agree on buddy separation procedures.

    Agree on time, depth and air supply limits.

    Discuss what to do if an emergency arises.

## Problem Management

* The goal is to create a safe habit so under stress it is a reflex not needing your brain
* Stay fit
* Stop Think Act
* Help
    1. Establich buoyancy
    2. Calm the diver
    3. Help him establish breath control
    4. Assist the diver to the boat or shore
* Save unresponsive
    1. Establish buyancy

# Questions to Abdullah:


1. Is that true that we consume proportionally more air as pressure increase? Because we could expect people not to have to consume the same volume, I mean to use less volume of air at hhigher pressure as this volume is dense enought to get one's doses of O2. (ref: Being a Diver I / Breathing Underwater Topic 4 of 6)
2. What do you think about the "__Pony Bottle__" small bottle 1 Litter you can inflate by hand (mini scuba tank). Can those be used alone, for fun 5 minutes (of course dangerously). What would be the precausions?
3. Why dont they craft 30L bottles (max 15 acording to PADI)


# Questions to Abdullah 2 (after exam)
