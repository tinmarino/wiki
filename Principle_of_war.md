# Principle of War


In warfare, a number of driving principles can be derived which indicate basic
ideas by which war is prosecuted.


# 9 Principles Of War 
As defined in the Army Field Manual 22-100,  Military Leadership, and applied
to Business and Information Security. 9 Principles of War


| Goal                | Description                                                                                     |

| 6 Maneuver:         | Place the enemy in a position of disadvantage through the flexible application of combat power. |
| 7 Unity of command: | For every objective, ensure unity of effort under one responsible commander.                    |
| 8 Security:         | Never permit the enemy to acquire an unexpected advantage.                                      |
| 9 Simplicity:       | Prepare clear, uncomplicated plans and concise orders to ensure thorough understanding.         |


War is the continuation of policy (politics) by other means.
If you entrench yourself behind strong fortifications, you compel the enemy to
seek a solution elsewhere.
Never forget that no military leader has ever become great without audacity.
If the leader is filled with high ambition and if he pursues his aims with
audacity and strength of will, he will reach them in spite of all obstacles.
- Karl von Clausewitz


# Principles of War Propaganda 
In 2001 (before 9/11), Belgian historian Anne Morelli (fr) published a book
analyzing the basic principles of war propaganda.  She credits the work of
Lord Ponsonby, an amazing and unfortunately somewhat forgotten character. He
stood, largely alone, in the Commons opposing WWI before it started,
predicting not just the massacre it was going to be, but more interestingly
for our purpose, how it was going to be sold to the masses.
Morelli enumerates it as the following principles:
  1.  We don't want war, we are only defending ourselves 
  2. The other guy is the sole responsible for this war 
  3. Our adversary's leader is evil and looks evil 
  4. We are defending a noble purpose, not special interest 
  5. The enemy is purposefully causing atrocities; we only commit mistakes 
  6. The enemy is using unlawful weapons 
  7. We have very little losses, the enemy is losing big 
  8. Intellectuals and artists support our cause 
  9. Our cause is sacred 
 10. Those who doubt our propaganda are traitors.
