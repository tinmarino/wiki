### Fold

Create ~
zf 	                Operator to create fold
                    zf10j, zf/string, zf'a
Move ~
zj 		            To the next fold.
zk 		            To the previous fold.
]z 		            To end of open fold.
[z 		            To start of open fold.

Change ~
zo, zO              Opens a (all) fold at the cursor.
zc, zC 		        Close (all) 
zm 		            Increases the foldlevel by one.
zM   		        Closes all open folds.
zr 		            Decreases the foldlevel by one.
zR   		        Decreases the foldlevel to zero -- all folds will be open.
zd 		            Deletes the fold at the cursor.
zE 		            Deletes all folds.


                                                             *v-fold-commands*

set "foldtext"              " witch show what you see when folded 
:set foldmethod=expr
:set foldexpr=empty(getline(v:lnum))?'=':indent(v:lnum)/4





## Ex mode

    

================================================================================
																		  *v-ex*

http://www.csb.yale.edu/userguides/wordprocess/vi-summary.html


:t$                 Copy current line to the end
:#                  Display current line number
:&                  Repeat last substitue
:42                 Jump to line 42, as does typing42G.
:e .                Edit: Open integrated explorer



Advanced ~

:#n  and  :#<n      Are replaced by file buffer n or oldfiles n


" Changin PWD when pressing ctrl-z
set autochdir to auto chdir to current file
:tabdo lcd /dir/
Another useful setting is set tags=./tags,tags;$HOME which tells Vim to look
    for a tags file in the directory of the current file, then in the "current
    directory" and up and up until it reaches your ~/. 
getpid()
vim â€”cmd 'cd `pwd`'




                                                                    *v-ex-man*
runtime! ftplugin/man.vim
:Man 3 printf
:h find-manpage 

                                                                 *v-ex-buffer*
:argdel *           Delete the existing argument list
:bufdo argadd %     For each buffer, add the buffer's path to the list
:1,1000bd           Delete buffers 1 to 1000; probably there's a better way to do this
:argdo e            For each argument, edit that argument
:bufhiden           Can unload a buffer < then not visible
		            Very cool for scratch buufer (warning they are permanently
                    lost)

                                                                   *v-ex-diff*
set diffopt+=iwhite  " ignore spacelines
set diffexpr=
:diffupdate


                                                                   *v-ex-tips*
:tab help foo
:!tidy -mi -html -wrap 0 %
:<n>,<m> w filename
:ccl                Close it quickfix
