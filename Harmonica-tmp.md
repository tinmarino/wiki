Song: 	"Girl From The North Country" - Bob Dylan (Bb)

There is another tab of this song in the key of Ab. Enjoy this tab
with the harmonica solos as single notes in the key of Bb. You will
notice that this tab of the harmonica solos are not spaced to provide
the true length of each note. Also, when necessary loosen up to make
more of a chord sound. If you play it and find any errors or necessary
additions or deletions, let me know and I will make the necessary
changes. All in fun!!

If you're traveling the north country fair
3     4   5     4   6  6  -5 5   -5 4  5
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
4 4  3   4  3  2   3   2     1
Remember me to one who lives there
1   1   2    3   2 3    2    2  1
For she once was a true love of mine.
-4 4   5  4    4   6   -5     4
If you go when the snowflakes storm
4    4   5 5    6      5   -5 4   5
When the rivers freeze and summer ends
4      4   3  4   4   3 3    2  1
Please see if she has a coat so warm
1  1    2   3    2   3  2    1
To keep her from the howlin' winds.
4      5   -4 4   6    -4    4
Please see if her hair hangs long
4  4  5     4   6     -5  5    -4  5
If it rolls and flows all down her breast
4      4   3   4  3  2   3      2  2    1
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long
1   1      2   3   2 2 3  2   2   1
For that's the way I remember her best.
4   3 4  3  4   5  4   4 6  6    -5 5  4
I'm a-wonderin' if she remembers me at all
5 5  6     5    -54   5
Many times I've often prayed
4  3   4   4    3  2  1
In the darkness of my night
1  2   3     2    3  2  1
In the brightness of my day.
