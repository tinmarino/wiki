An AngularJS Style Guide for Closure Users at Google {#an-angularjs-style-guide-for-closure-users-at-google .external}
====================================================

This is the external version of a document that was primarily written
for Google engineers. It describes a recommended style for AngularJS
apps that use Closure, as used internally at Google. Members of the
broader AngularJS community should feel free to apply (or not apply)
these recommendations, as relevant to their own use cases.

This document describes style for AngularJS apps in google3. This guide
supplements and extends the [Google JavaScript Style
Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html).

**Style Note**: Examples on the AngularJS external webpage, and many
external apps, are written in a style that freely uses closures, favors
functional inheritance, and does not often use [JavaScript
types](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler/wiki/Types-in-the-Closure-Type-System){.external}.
Google follows a more rigorous Javascript style to support JSCompiler
optimizations and large code bases - see the javascript-style mailing
list. This is not an Angular-specific issue, and is not discussed
further in this style guide. (But if you want further reading: [Martin
Fowler on closures](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/Lambda.html), [much
longer description](http://jibbering.com/faq/notes/closures/), appendix
A of the [closure
book](https://books.google.com/books/about/Closure_The_Definitive_Guide.html?id=p7uyWPcVGZsC)
has a good description of inheritance patterns and why it prefers
pseudoclassical, [Javascript, the Good
Parts](https://books.google.com/books/about/JavaScript.html?id=PXa2bby0oQ0C)
as a counter.)

1 Angular Language Rules
------------------------

### Manage dependencies with Closure\'s goog.require and goog.provide {#googprovide}

Choose a namespace for your project, and use goog.provide and
goog.require.

``` {.prettyprint .lang-js}
goog.provide('hello.about.AboutCtrl');
goog.provide('hello.versions.Versions');
```

**Why?** Google BUILD rules integrate nicely with closure
provide/require.

### Modules

Your main application module should be in your root client directory. A
module should never be altered other than the one where it is defined.

Modules may either be defined in the same file as their components (this
works well for a module that contains exactly one service) or in a
separate file for wiring pieces together.

**Why?** A module should be consistent for anyone that wants to include
it as a reusable component. If a module can mean different things
depending on which files are included, it is not consistent.

### Modules should reference other modules using the Angular Module\'s \"name\" property {#moduledeps}

For example:

``` {.prettyprint .lang-js}
// file submodulea.js:
  goog.provide('my.submoduleA');

  my.submoduleA = angular.module('my.submoduleA', []);
  // ...

// file app.js
  goog.require('my.submoduleA');

  Yes: my.application.module = angular.module('hello', [my.submoduleA.name]);
  
      No: my.application.module = angular.module('hello', ['my.submoduleA']);
  
```

**Why?** Using a property of my.submoduleA prevents Closure presubmit
failures complaining that the file is required but never used. Using the
.name property avoids duplicating strings.

### Use a common externs file {#externs}

This maximally allows the JS compiler to enforce type safety in the
presence of externally provided types from Angular, and means you don\'t
have to worry about Angular vars being obfuscated in a confusing way.

Note to readers outside Google: the current externs file is located in
an internal-to-Google directory, but an example can be found on github
[here](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/4722).

### JSCompiler Flags {#compilerflags}

**Reminder**: According to the JS style guide, customer facing code must
be compiled.

**Recommended**: Use the JSCompiler (the closure compiler that works
with js\_binary by default) and ANGULAR\_COMPILER\_FLAGS\_FULL from
//javascript/angular/build\_defs/build\_defs for your base flags.

Note - if you are using \@export for methods, you will need to add the
compiler flag

    "--generate_exports",

If you are using \@export for properties, you will need to add the
flags:

    "--generate_exports",
    "--remove_unused_prototype_props_in_externs=false",
    "--export_local_property_definitions",

### Controllers and Scopes {#controllers}

Controllers are classes. Methods should be defined on MyCtrl.prototype.

Google Angular applications should use the **\'controller as\'** style
to export the controller onto the scope. This is fully implemented in
Angular 1.2 and can be mimicked in pre-Angular 1.2 builds.

Pre Angular 1.2, this looks like:

``` {.prettyprint .lang-js}
/**
 * Home controller.
 *
 * @param {!angular.Scope} $scope
 * @constructor
 * @ngInject
 * @export
 */
hello.mainpage.HomeCtrl = function($scope) {
  /** @export */
  $scope.homeCtrl = this; // This is a bridge until Angular 1.2 controller-as

  /**
   * @type {string}
   * @export
   */
  this.myColor = 'blue';
};


/**
 * @param {number} a
 * @param {number} b
 * @export
 */
hello.mainpage.HomeCtrl.prototype.add = function(a, b) {
  return a + b;
};
```

And the template:

    <div ng-controller="hello.mainpage.HomeCtrl"/>
      <span ng-class="homeCtrl.myColor">I'm in a color!</span>
      <span>{{homeCtrl.add(5, 6)}}</span>
    </div>

After Angular 1.2, this looks like:

``` {.prettyprint .lang-js}
/**
 * Home controller.
 *
 * @constructor
 * @ngInject
 * @export
 */
hello.mainpage.HomeCtrl = function() {
  /**
   * @type {string}
   * @export
   */
  this.myColor = 'blue';
};


/**
 * @param {number} a
 * @param {number} b
 * @export
 */
hello.mainpage.HomeCtrl.prototype.add = function(a, b) {
  return a + b;
};
```

If you are compiling with property renaming, expose properties and
methods using the \@export annotation. Remember to \@export the
constructor as well.

And in the template:

    <div ng-controller="hello.mainpage.HomeCtrl as homeCtrl"/>
      <span ng-class="homeCtrl.myColor">I'm in a color!</span>
      <span>{{homeCtrl.add(5, 6)}}</span>
    </div>

**Why?** Putting methods and properties directly onto the controller,
instead of building up a scope object, fits better with the Google
Closure class style. Additionally, using \'controller as\' makes it
obvious which controller you are accessing when multiple controllers
apply to an element. Since there is always a \'.\' in the bindings, you
don\'t have to worry about prototypal inheritance masking primitives.

### Directives

All DOM manipulation should be done inside directives. Directives should
be kept small and use composition. Files defining directives should
goog.provide a static function which returns the directive definition
object.

``` {.prettyprint .lang-js}
goog.provide('hello.pane.paneDirective');

/**
 * Description and usage
 * @return {angular.Directive} Directive definition object.
 */
hello.pane.paneDirective = function() {
  // ...
};
```

**Exception**: DOM manipulation may occur in services for DOM elements
disconnected from the rest of the view, e.g. dialogs or keyboard
shortcuts.

### Services

Services registered on the module with `module.service` are classes. Use
`module.service` instead of `module.provider` or `module.factory` unless
you need to do initialization beyond just creating a new instance of the
class.

``` {.prettyprint .lang-js}
/**
 * @param {!angular.$http} $http The Angular http service.
 * @constructor
 */
hello.request.Request = function($http) {
  /** @type {!angular.$http} */
  this.http_ = $http;
};

hello.request.Request.prototype.get = function() {/*...*/};
```

In the module:

``` {.prettyprint .lang-js}
module.service('request', hello.request.Request);
```

2 Angular Style Rules
---------------------

### Reserve \$ for Angular properties and services {#dollarsign}

Do not use \$ to prepend your own object properties and service
identifiers. Consider this style of naming reserved by AngularJS and
jQuery.

Yes:

``` {.prettyprint .lang-js}
  $scope.myModel = { value: 'foo' }
  myModule.service('myService', function() { /*...*/ });
  var MyCtrl = function($http) {this.http_ = $http;};
```

No:

``` {.prettyprint}
  $scope.$myModel = { value: 'foo' } // BAD
  $scope.myModel = { $value: 'foo' } // BAD
  myModule.service('$myService', function() { ... }); // BAD
  var MyCtrl = function($http) {this.$http_ = $http;}; // BAD
```

**Why?** It\'s useful to distinguish between Angular / jQuery builtins
and things you add yourself. In addition, \$ is not an acceptable
character for variables names in the JS style guide.

### Custom elements {#customelements}

For custom elements (e.g. `<ng-include src="template"></ng-include>`),
IE8 requires special support (html5shiv-like hacks) to enable css
styling. Be aware of this restriction in apps targeting old versions of
IE.

3 Angular Tips, Tricks, and Best Practices
------------------------------------------

These are not strict style guide rules, but are placed here as reference
for folks getting started with Angular at Google.

### Testing

Angular is designed for test-driven development.

The recommended unit testing setup is Jasmine + Karma (though you could
use closure tests or js\_test)

Angular provides easy adapters to load modules and use the injector in
Jasmine tests.

-   [module](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/angular.mock.module)
-   [inject](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/angular.mock.inject)

### Consider using the Best Practices for App Structure {#appstructure}

This [directory structure
doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XXMvReO8-Awi1EZXAXS4PzDzdNvV6pGcuaF4Q9821Es/pub)
describes how to structure your application with controllers in nested
subdirectories and all components (e.g. services and directives) in a
\'components\' dir.

### Be aware of how scope inheritance works {#scopeinheritance}

See [The Nuances of Scope Prototypal
Inheritance](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/wiki/Understanding-Scopes#wiki-JSproto)

### Use \@ngInject for easy dependency injection compilation {#nginject}

This removes the need to add `myCtrl['$inject'] = ...` to prevent
minification from messing up Angular\'s dependency injection.

Usage:

``` {.prettyprint .lang-js}
/**
 * My controller.
 * @param {!angular.$http} $http
 * @param {!my.app.myService} myService
 * @constructor
 * @export
 * @ngInject
 */
my.app.MyCtrl = function($http, myService) {
  //...
};
```
