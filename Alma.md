# Science -> Submillimetre astronomy

* mm/sub-mm wavelength region are essential for investigating the coolest components of outer space such as cold and dusty molecular clouds, where star formation is occurring
* carbon monoxide rotational transition
  * between the first level and the ground state of the molecule from Messier 51 (=NGC5194).
  * The carbon monoxide is thought to represent the distribution of the molecular hydrogen, which cannnot emit at low temperatures.
* Broad band 16 GhZ wide


# Emission

1. Discrete cosmic radio sources, at first, supernova remnants and radio galaxies
(1948; see Kirshner 2004),
2. The 21 cm line of atomic hydrogen (1951; see Sparke and Gallagher 2007;
Kalberla et al. , 2005),
3. Quasi Stellar Objects or “Quasars” (1963; see Begelman and Rees 2009),
4. The Cosmic Microwave Background (1965; see Silk 2008),
5. Interstellar molecules (1968; see Herbst and Dishoeck 2009) and the connection
with Star Formation, including circumstellar and protoplanetary disks (see
Stahler and Palla 2005; Reipurth et al. 2007),
6. Pulsars (1968; see Lyne and Graham-Smith 2012),
7. Distance determinations using source proper motions determined from Very
Long Baseline Interferometry (see Reid 1993),
8. The Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect (see, e.g. Marrone et al. 2012)
9. Gravitational Lenses
10. Molecules in high redshift sources (see Solomon and Vanden Bout 2005).
