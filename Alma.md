# Science -> Submillimetre astronomy

* mm/sub-mm wavelength region are essential for investigating the coolest components of outer space such as cold and dusty molecular clouds, where star formation is occurring
* carbon monoxide rotational transition
  * between the first level and the ground state of the molecule from Messier 51 (=NGC5194).
  * The carbon monoxide is thought to represent the distribution of the molecular hydrogen, which cannnot emit at low temperatures.
* Broad band 16 GhZ wide

## Antenas

* 54x12m + 12x7m = 66 antenas
* 100 micro-metter -> 1 milli-meter = 100 GHz
* Pointing precision: 0.6 arcseconds


## Receiver

* 4°K cryostats
* Example: The Parkes multibeam receiver
* Feed Horn -> Cables -> Receiver / Amplifier -> Recording device


## Optic fiber

## Correlator

## Interferometry

* Optical resolution: θ=206000λ/D, 
* phase closure to correct seeing: (3 antenas)
* “amplitude  closure (4 antenas)
* phase tracking: real time, time dealys correction

## Transporters
