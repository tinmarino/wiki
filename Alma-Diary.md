Hi teammate,

I'm new in this collocation. Glad to see the house so ordered: I feel like at home :-)
May you escuse me to put my bags here, in the entry!

Some notes and ideas, please comment, add, remove ...

1. Tidy the home with some folders
2. Mutualise the build scripts so that reproducing one is as expensive as settting its name: 2020AUG-TelCalSA-Deployment, and so that they can be gitted
3.

  2.1. I may create my user so that I get some conf for shell section (alias, vim plugin, tmux), It may be overkill, I'll see with Camilo
   -> Yes it is overkill: We mostly use it from firefox
