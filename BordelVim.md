The *v-statusline* option

This is a line at the bottom to get hud text. The ruler is supperposed to the
statusline. 
If you want to play with it, first run 
>vim
  set noruler
  set laststatus=2 
<vim
Then you can see what you are doing.

For a *default-statusline* you can take this one 
>vim
  :set statusline=%<%f\ %h%m%r\ %y%=%{v:register}\ %-14.(%l,%c%V%)\ %P
<vim
You can also change ruler with 
>vim
  :set rulerformat=%-14.(%l,%c%V%)\ %P
<vim

Add Help ~

In my runtime folder (ex ~/.vim/), in a doc folder I have many help files with
documentation. They must be in a runtimepath/doc and not in a nested directory
there.

The Filename must start with the type and the tags are in separated with '#'

The first line of the file can contains a tag and it will then be added to the
local-addtions help file (see :h local-addtions)

Dont forget to run helptags ./ in the current dir (doc) or just :Helptags for
all pathogen stuff for the tags to be generated. Then the command :h will
search them in a runtimepath/doc folder
