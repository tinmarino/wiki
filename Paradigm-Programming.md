	* Structured programming is a programming paradigm aimed at improving the clarity, quality, and development time of a computer program by making extensive use of the structured control flow constructs of selection (if/then/else) and repetition (while and for), block structures, and subroutines

# Imperative

In which the programmer instructs the machine how to change its state,
	* procedural which groups instructions into procedures,
	* object-oriented which groups instructions together with the part of the state they operate on,


# Declarative

In which the programmer merely declares properties of the desired result, but not how to compute it.
  * Markup, Regex, Query (SQL)
	* functional in which the desired result is declared as the value of a series of function applications,
	* logic in which the desired result is declared as the answer to a question about a system of facts and rules,
	* mathematical in which the desired result is declared as the solution of an optimization problem
	* Symbolic programming is a paradigm that describes programs able to manipulate formulas and program components as data (Lisp, Prolog)

# More

	* litterate documentation is integral to the program, and the program is structured following the logic of prose exposition, rather than compiler convenience.
	* Process-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that separates the concerns of data structures and the concurrent processes that act upon them
