title: Common Vulnerability Scoring System
---


# List

## B: Base

### AV: Attack vector

1. N: Network
2. A: Adjacent
3. L: Local
4. P: Physical


### AC: Attack Complexity

1. Low
2. High

### AT: Attack Requirements

1. None
2. Present

### PR: Priviledges required

1. None  <= anyone
2. Low   <= user
3. High  <= admin

### UI: User Interactions

1. None
2. Passive
3. Active

### Impact

1. Confidenciality
2. Integrity
3. Avalability

To target system and other system (colateral victim)

Note1: RCE has high impact in all
Note2: If this is all zero, the CVSS is zero (think of it as multiplicative)

# S: Supplemental

No impact on the CVSS Score

1. Safety
2. Automatable
3. Recovery
4. Provider Urgency
5. Value Density  <= price of the resource the attacker will obtain
6. Vulenrability Response Effort

# T: Threat

Change with time

### E: Exploit maturity:

(X) Not defined, (A) Attacked, (P) POC, (U) Unreported


# E: Environmental

It changes with the target
It all depends on the __Security Requirements__ of the target system


### Modified base metrics
